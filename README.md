# GPT-4 Invoice Processing for Sangam Supermarket & Wholesale

In the dynamic environment of Sangam Supermarket & Wholesale, the manual handling of irregular and unstructured invoices was consuming valuable time and resources. In response, I launched a hobby project in fall 2023, utilizing GPT-4o-mini and custom scripts to automate invoice processing and inventory management, streamlining operations significantly.

This initiative is part of our ongoing efforts to modernize and improve efficiency, ensuring that the management team can focus on strategic goals rather than routine tasks. The repository includes a series of scripts and programs that integrate into our existing systems to facilitate a seamless transition to automated processes, improving accuracy and reducing overhead.

This is one of the earliest versions of my program to display on my portfolio to hopefully help others out and garner intrest for intership oppurtunities.
